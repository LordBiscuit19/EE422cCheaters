“The Cheaters!” program’s functionality is to compare multiple text-based files in a file system and detect patterns of similarity.  It finds common word sequences among documents in a closed set. The input will be the directory to a set of plain-text documents and two integers to the command line. The directory will hold the essays to be checked for cheating. The first integer will be the number of words that will be grouped together and looked for throughout each of the text-based files. The second integer input will be the tolerance threshold for similarity. If two files have more than the threshold limit of word sequences in common it will output the two files for suspicion of cheating. 
	We achieve this by creating a linked hash-map consisting of n-numbered word sets as the keys and a set of files mapped to those keys. We chose to use a linked hash-map opposed to any alternative as a linked hash-map maintains the order in which the keys are created, and a map inherently prevents more than one same n-numbered word keys being created. The keys are created by scanning through each document, creating a n-numbered word queue, removing any non-alphanumeric characters, and creating the string representation for that chunk. After the creation of the key the queue will remove the first element and add the next word in the text documents and repeat the process until all text-based files have been processed. 
	When adding keys to the map the program first checks to see if the key already exists. If the key does already exist the program inserts the file object that the key came from into the set of files associate with that key in the map. If the key does not exist it is added to the map and a new set of files is created with the file the key came from being added as an entry to the set. Upon completion the map is then traversed and a 2D matrix is created. The indexes of the rows and columns of the 2d matrix will correspond to individual text-based files. Every occurrence of similarity is then mapped to the matrix. The similarity matrix is then traversed and when the tolerance threshold is met or exceeded the suspect files will be printed.
